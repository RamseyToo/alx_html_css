## Figma Design

The design was created in **Figma**, and all visual references, spacing, colors, and fonts were taken from the Figma project.  

**Important Notes from Figma:**

- Fonts used:  
  - `Source Sans Pro`  
  - `Spin Cycle OT`  
- Some spacing values are in floats – rounding is acceptable where necessary.  
- Mobile version activates at screen width ≤ 480px.
